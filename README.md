# Target-Store-Case-Study
Target is a globally renowned brand and a prominent retailer in the United States. Target makes itself a preferred shopping destination by offering outstanding value, inspiration, innovation and an exceptional guest experience that no other retailer can deliver.

This particular business case focuses on the operations of Target in Brazil and provides insightful information about 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The dataset offers a comprehensive view of various dimensions including the order status, price, payment and freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews.

By analyzing this extensive dataset, it becomes possible to gain valuable insights into Target's operations in Brazil. The information can shed light on various aspects of the business, such as order processing, pricing strategies, payment and shipping efficiency, customer demographics, product characteristics, and customer satisfaction levels.

# The data is available in 8 csv files:

# Problem Statement:
Assuming you are a data analyst/ scientist at Target, you have been assigned the task of analyzing the given dataset to extract valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations.

# Insights from the Data Analysis done on BiqQuery:
• Number of orders increased rapidly from 2016 up until 2017. However, it was less in 2018 due to the fact that there was no sufficient data from 2018. But overall the sales trend is upward.

• Further, we see that sales peak in the mid-year period during the months of May, July and August.

• We can see that customers buy more during the afternoons and mornings.

• We can see that most of the customers come from the state of SP, RJ and MG which contribute to more than 60% of total customers.

• There is 137% increase in total cost of orders from 2017 to 2018.

• We see that the cost of freight is around 1/6 of the price.

• The state of SP has the highest number of orders and the lowest average cost of freight.

• We can also see that as the volume of orders decreases from state to state, the freight price increases.

• The state RR has the highest average freight cost most time taken to deliver.

• The state AM is the fastest in terms of delivery time, which is around 2.29 days.

• The number of credit card payments is the highest. Whereas payments made through debit cards are the lowest.

• We can observe the number of one-time purchases is highest. The number of purchases decreases when the number of installments increase.

# Recommendation:
• We can recommend Target to give more discounts and benefits to debit card customers, because this payment type is least used.

• Inventory management and logistics should be improved in certain states (mentioned above), to decrease the delivery time.

• Estimation of delivery should be more aligned with the actual delivery time, so that customers don’t receive the orders at unexpected time.

• Improved logistics will also decrease the average freight costs.

• The state SP is very important for Target, since it is where most orders come from. Target should focus on reducing the delivery time in this region.

• The number of orders is less for products where the number of installments is more – which are generally higher value purchases. To increase the affordability of bigger purchases, Target should provide no cost EMI and discounts for purchases with 12 installments or more.

• Overall month on month sales is increasing. Therefore, Target should focus on expanding in the Brazil market so as to not face any shortages or delays.
